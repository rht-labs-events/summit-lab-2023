One of the goals of this lab is to demonstrate how everything is done through the modern web browser. This means that the developers computer does not need to be tweaked or configured beyond having a working browser that can connect to corporate services. Many of you may be used to accessing "the terminal" natively on your machine to do work - no more. In this lab we will see how the RH OpenShift Dev Spaces environment provides the necssary tools, including terminals, to get the job done.

Launching RH OpenShift Dev Spaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Up to this point, we were exploring the environment with the System Administrator lense on - seeing how the core components were deployed to support the need of our developers. It is now time to switch roles and become the developer that will use the environment.

Let us start by navigating to the RH OpenShift Dev Spaces environment in the browser on this computer. Click the link below: +
https://devspaces.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}

Click the "Log in with OpenShift" button (screenshot below)

Introduction to DevFiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The purpose of DevFiles ... blah bla

Big Picture - Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we have a working RH OpenShift Dev Spaces environment, let's cycle back to the Big Picture to see what the next steps are. In this case we will use the Big Picture to show the future state of what we will deploy in the following exercises.

Towards the bottom, we now have two user workspaces filled in with the application technologies. One with node.js and mongodb - this is our "Junior Developer environment, and the other is the "Advanced Developer" working on a soution including the use of Quarkus.

Let's start as a junior developer, and deploy a basic application that needs a few extra components to work.
