One of the goals of this lab is to demonstrate how everything is done through the modern web browser. This means that the developers computer does not need to be tweaked or configured beyond having a working browser that can connect to corporate services. Many of you may be used to accessing "the terminal" natively on your machine to do work - no more. In this lab we will see how the RH OpenShift Dev Spaces environment provides the necssary tools, including terminals, to get the job done.
