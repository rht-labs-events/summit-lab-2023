Let us start with the basic deployment, as a junior developer. First thing first is to fork the project we will be working on to have our own playground to make changes in.

=== Forking our Guestbook Application

The process of making a fork of a git reposity is a very common process to make sure you operate in an isolated version of the source code. This means you will only impact yourself (and anybody else you have granted access to) if you make breaking changes, and you will not be impacted by others working in their fork of the repository. 

NOTE: As you may expect, there is a bit of overhead maintaining your fork and keeping it current with the upstream repository, but this is outside of the scope of this lab.

Let's go! +
 +
 +

===== Using the GitLab UI 

[start=1]
. Login to GitLab - using the SSO username/password. +
*Note: Skip the username/password fields and click the "RH SSO" button towards the bottom - see screenshot below.*

NOTE: You can safely ignore any warnings about missing SSH keys, access tokens or otherwise a need to add authentication mechanisms. This has all been taken care of by the OAuth integration mentioned earlier, and you will get to see how this just works without adding any user specific configurations manually. Feel free to close these pop-ups to avoid seeing them.

GitLab URL:
https://gitlab.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}}

[start=2]
. Click the `Explore public projects` box towards the bottom left, then navigate to "Explore >> All" in the top menu system.

[start=3]
. Next look for the project that is named "Administrator / guestbook". Click this line to enter into this project. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-admin-guestbook.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-admin-guestbook.png]

[start=4]
. This is where you make a fork of the project. Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-fork-button.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-fork-button.png]

[start=5]
. On the next screen leave everything as pre-populated, with the exception of the `Select a namespace` drop-down - click this, and select your username from the drop-down. Then click the `Fork project` button and wait for the process to complete.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-fork-guestbook.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-fork-guestbook.png]

[start=6]
. The screen show now have advanced to your fork of the repositoty. This can be validated by looking at the URL in the browser - the end of the URL should read `<username>/guestbook` where `<username>` is your SSO username.  +
+
While we are in this view, let's grab the URL to clone this repository for the next step - click on the blue `Clone` drop-down button and click the `Copy URL` button next to the "Clone with HTTPS" box.

===== DONE

You now have a fork that is safe to make changes to, and you automatically have write permissions to make changes within this repository. As you go forward with the next steps, make sure to follow the instructions carefully and use your fork of the source code. 

Next we will launch this version of the application in RH OpenShift Dev Spaces so we can see it run and start making changes to the application.
 +

=== Launching the forked application in RH OpenShift Dev Spaces

This is where the fun begins - now that we have our own playground to play in, we need an IDE to make the changes. This is where RH OpenShift Dev Spaces shines. Let's take a look. +
 +

===== Create a new workspace

[start=1]
. Make sure you have completed the steps in the *Getting Started* chapter and have a valid session to the RH OpenShift Dev Spaces dashboard - seen below. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-create-workspace.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=750,height=750,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-create-workspace.png]


[start=2]
. Next, make sure you completed the steps above to create a fork of the upstream guestbook application. Then enter the URL you grabbed in the last step of the forking process into the "Import from Git" / "Git Repo URL" box. Then click the `Create & Open` button.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-create-and-open.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=550,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-create-and-open.png]

[start=3]
. Wait for the workspace to start - this may take a minute or two.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-wait-to-start.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=850,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-wait-to-start.png]

[start=4]
. Welcome to RH OpenShift Dev Spaces! If you are seeing prompts to trust the author, etc. please click `Trust Workspace and Install` / `Yes, I trust the authors` and proceeed to you see an IDE like the screenshot below. 

NOTE: You can choose either *accept* or *deny* for the analystics pop-up to help Red Hat improve the extensions - for this lab these data is not collected anyway. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-welcome.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-welcome.png]

[start=5]
. To better navigate the UI, we will install an extension to aid with running this application. We will cover more about extensions in the next chapter, but for now just click on the "Extensions" menun option in the left-hand side margin and search for "Task Manager" to install this extension from teh marketplace. Once found, click on the blue "Install" button and wait for the task to complete. You should now have a new left-hand side margin item at the bottom that is the "Task Manager". +
 +
Feel free to close the "Extension: Task Manager" window that is visible in the middle of the screen. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-task-manager.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=450,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-task-manager.png]

NOTE: Any changes made in this runtime environment is automatically saved and persisted across restarts of *this* instance of the workspace. If you choose to delete the workspace these changes are lost, but permanent customizations can be added to the DevFile and other Workspaces config files - more on this later.

[start=6]
. Click on the "Task Manager" and choose the `Build and Run the application` under `devfile` at the top, then click the "play" symbol to the right of the line.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-build-and-run.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=450,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-build-and-run.png]

[start=7]
. This will bring up a Terminal output window at the bottom of the browser view - including a few other tabs, such as "Problems", "Output", "Debug Console". +
 +
*Oh No!* The run resulted in an error!! Feel free to explore the error output more to figure out why. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-build-failure.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-build-failure.png]

[start=8]
. As you probably figured out, this problem is due to not having a MongoDB to connect to. Someone must have left this repository in a bad state after making some changes earlier. Let's add the DB - locally in the workspace - which means we are still just operating as if this was running locally on a laptop. +
 +
Click on the `Explorer` icon in the left-side margin menu to see the various files in this repository. +
 +
Click on the `devfile.yaml` file as this will bring it into the center view where we can start making changes. Explore the `components` section of this file, and right now you will see that we have a `nodejs` section (line 5) and `npm` volume section (line 23). This is where we need to add one more component. +
 +
Copy the below snippet and paste it into the `components` section, right before line 26 / `commands`. 

[source,yaml]]
  - name: mongo
    container:
      image: registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-36-rhel7:1-50
      env:
        - name: MONGODB_USER
          value: user
        - name: MONGODB_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: MONGODB_DATABASE
          value: guestbook
        - name: MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD
          value: password
      endpoints:
        - name: mongodb
          exposure: internal
          targetPort: 27017
      memoryLimit: 512Mi
      mountSources: false
      volumeMounts:
        - name: mongo-storage
          path: /var/lib/mongodb/data
  - name: mongo-storage
    volume:
      size: 1G


The resulting file should look like the following screenshot. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-added-mongodb.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=650,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-added-mongodb.png]

[start=9]
. With the change in place, it is time to push this change to our git repository so we can give it a try. +
 +
To the right of the `devfile.yaml` in the `Explorer` view you can see `M` - this indicates that the file was modified and should be added and committed to the repositoty. +
 +
Again, in the left-hand side margin menu, click on the "Source Control" icon, then follow these steps:
  a. Click the `+` next to the `devfile.yaml` file
  b. Enter a commit message at the top - for example: "_Adding mongodb to my workspace_"
  c. Click the blue "Commit" button below
  d. Click the tripple dots `...` in the top menu of the Source Control view, and select `push`

NOTE: The IDE may ask if you would like periodically run git fetch. While it doesn't matter for this lab, it is good to see that this feature exists to assist with keeping your local clone current, but for now you can choose to answer either `Yes` or `No` to this question. 

[start=10]
. The source code has been updated, but the runtime is still using the old devfile. Let's fix this by making the changes inline. Alternatively we could delete and re-create the workspace, but that would mean starting over for some of the other non-permanent changes we have made so far. +
 +
In the browser, you should find the RH OpenShift Dev Spaces dashboard as another tab - select this tab. Click on "Workspaces (1)" in the left hand side menu, and you should see the "guestbook" workspace running (a green circle next to it). +
 +
For this next step, it is crucial to click on `guestbook` in the center "Workspaces" view - not the left-hand side "Recent Workspaces". The former brings up the workspaces settings (which we want), while the latter brings up a new tab with an active window into the running workspace. +
 +
Click the "Devfile" tab to see the active runtime devfile. Similar to how we added the mongodb to the permanent devfile, let's copy the above snippet and paste it here as well - right before the `commands` section. +

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-added-mongodb-inline.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-added-mongodb-inline.png]

[start=11]
. Click the blue "Save" button in the bottom right corner. This will present a prompt asking if you want to "Restart Workspace" - answer `Yes` to this prompt.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-restart-workspace.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=550,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-restart-workspace.png]

[start=11]
. Next click the `guestbook` link in the left-hand side menu to re-open the session - now with the new runtime changes.

[start=12]
. Repeat step #6 from above by clicking the play icon of the "Build and Run the application" line in the "Task Manager"

[start=13]
. *Success* The Terminal is now just showing a few warnings, but otherwise also indicating that the app is listening on port 8080. Speaking of port 8080, there is a pop-up in the bottom right of the browser that is letting you know that there is a service listening on port 8080 and asking if you would like to open it - click the `Open in New Tab` blue button.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-open-port-8080.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=350,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-open-port-8080.png]

As a good security measurement, it will double-check and ask if you want to open this link - for this purpose, we do trust it, so click the blue "Open" button.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-port-8080-security.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=450,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-port-8080-security.png]

[start=14]
. Congratulations - you now have a working guestbook application. Feel free to try it out and submit names and messages to your guestbook. +
 +
*Bonus:* If you navigate back to the workspaces tab, you will now see your data is echo'ed to the Terminal window for debugging purposes.
