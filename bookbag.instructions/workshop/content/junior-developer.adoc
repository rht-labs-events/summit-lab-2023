Let us start with the basic deployment, as a junior developer. The first task is to fork the project we will be working on to have our own playground to make changes in.

=== Forking our Guestbook Application

The process of making a fork of a git repository is a very common process that allows you to operate in an isolated version of the source code. This means you will only impact yourself (and anybody else you have granted access to) if you make breaking changes, and you will not be impacted by others working in their own individual forks of the repository. 

NOTE: As you may expect, there is a bit of overhead maintaining your fork and keeping it current with the upstream repository, but this is outside of the scope of this lab.

Let's go! +
 +
 +

===== Using the GitLab UI 

[start=1]
. Login to GitLab - using the SSO username/password. (_Hint:_ GitLab URL found below screenshot) +
*Note: Skip the username/password fields and click the "RH SSO" button towards the bottom.*

NOTE: In the subsequent pages, you will see warnings related to missing SSH keys, access tokens or otherwise a need to add authentication mechanisms. This has all been taken care of by the OAuth integration mentioned earlier, and you will get to see how this just works without adding any user specific configurations manually. Feel free to close these pop-ups to avoid seeing them.

GitLab URL:
https://gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}

[start=2]
. Click the **Explore public projects** box towards the bottom left, then navigate to **Explore** >> **All** in the top menu system.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-explore-projects.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=750,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-explore-projects.png]

[start=3]
. Next look for the project that is named **Administrator / guestbook**. Click this line to enter into this project. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-admin-guestbook.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-admin-guestbook.png]

[start=4]
. This is where you make a fork of the project. Click on the **Fork** button at the top right corner of the page. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-fork-button.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-fork-button.png]

[start=5]
. On the next screen leave everything as pre-populated, with the exception of the `Select a namespace` drop-down - click **Select a namespace**, and select your username from the drop-down. Then click the **Fork project** button and wait for the process to complete.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-fork-guestbook.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-fork-guestbook.png]

[start=6]
. The screen should now have advanced to your fork of the repository. This can be validated by looking at the URL in the browser - the end of the URL should read `<username>/guestbook` where `<username>` is your SSO username.  +
+
While we are in this view, let's grab the URL to clone this repository for the next step - click on the blue **Clone** drop-down button and click the **Copy URL button** next to the "Clone with HTTPS" box.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-clone-guestbook.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=850,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/gitlab-clone-guestbook.png]


===== DONE

You now have a fork that is safe to make changes to, and you automatically have write permissions to make changes within this repository. As you go forward with the next steps, make sure to follow the instructions carefully and use your fork of the source code. 

Next, we will launch this version of the application in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces so we can see it run and start making changes.
 +
 +
 +
 +

=== Launching the forked application in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

This is where the fun begins - now that we have our own playground to play in, we need an IDE to make the changes. This is where Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces shines. Let's take a look. +
 +

===== Create a new workspace

[start=1]
. Make sure you have completed the steps in the *Getting Started* chapter and have a valid session to the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces dashboard - seen below. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-create-workspace.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=750,height=750,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-create-workspace.png]

Switch back to this screen if you have navigated away previously.

[start=2]
. Next, make sure you completed the steps above to create a fork of the upstream guestbook application. Then enter the URL you grabbed in the last step of the forking process from the prior section into the "Import from Git" / "Git Repo URL" box. Then click the **Create & Open** button.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-create-and-open.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=550,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-create-and-open.png]

[start=3]
. The first time you access this GitLab instance from Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, it will prompt to authorize the use of your account for the OAuth integration. Click on the *Authorize* button to continue. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-gitlab-authorize.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=850,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-gitlab-authorize.png]

[start=4]
. Wait for the workspace to start - this may take a minute or two.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-wait-to-start.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=850,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-wait-to-start.png]

[start=5]
. Welcome to Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces! If you are seeing prompts to trust the author, etc. please click **Trust Workspace and Install** / **Yes, I trust the author**` and proceed until you see an IDE like the screenshot below. 

NOTE: You can choose either *accept* or *deny* for the analytics pop-up to help Red Hat improve the extensions - for this lab, this type of data is not collected anyway.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-welcome.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-welcome.png]

[start=6]
. To better navigate the UI, we will install an extension to aid with running this application. We will cover more about extensions in the next chapter, but for now, just click on the **Extensions** menu option in the left-hand side margin and search for "Task Manager" to install this extension from the marketplace. Once found, click on the blue **Install** button and wait for the task to complete. You should now have a new left-hand side margin item at the bottom that is the "Task Manager". +
 +
Feel free to close the "Extension: Task Manager" tab that is visible in the middle of the screen. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-task-manager.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=450,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-task-manager.png]

NOTE: Any changes made in this runtime environment is automatically saved and persisted across restarts of *this* instance of the workspace. If you choose to delete the workspace, these changes are lost, but permanent customizations can be added to the Devfile and other Workspaces config files - more on this later.

[start=7]
. Click on the "Task Manager" extension on the left-hand side margin and choose the `Build and Run the application` under `devfile` at the top, then click the "play" symbol to the right of the line.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-build-and-run.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=450,height=150,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-build-and-run.png]

[start=8]
. This will bring up a Terminal output window at the bottom of the browser view - including a few other tabs, such as "Problems", "Output", "Debug Console". +
 +
*Oh No!* The run resulted in an error!! Feel free to explore the error output more to figure out why. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-build-failure.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-build-failure.png]

[start=9]
. As you probably figured out, this problem is due to not having a MongoDB instance available to connect to. Someone must have left this repository in a bad state after making some changes earlier. Let's add the DB - locally in the workspace - which means we are still just operating as if this was running locally on a laptop. +
 +
Click on the `Explorer` icon in the left-side margin menu to see the various files in this repository. +
 +
Click on the `devfile.yaml` file as this will bring the contents into the center view where we can start making changes. Explore the `components` section of this file, and right now you will see that we have a `nodejs` section (line 5) and `npm` volume section (line 23). This is where we need to add one more component. +
 +
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-select-devfile.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=250,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-select-devfile.png]

Copy the below snippet and paste it into the `components` section, right before line 26 / `commands`. 

[source,yaml]
  - name: mongo
    container:
      image: registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-36-rhel7:1-50
      env:
        - name: MONGODB_USER
          value: user
        - name: MONGODB_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: MONGODB_DATABASE
          value: guestbook
        - name: MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD
          value: password
      endpoints:
        - name: mongodb
          exposure: internal
          targetPort: 27017
      memoryLimit: 512Mi
      mountSources: false
      volumeMounts:
        - name: mongo-storage
          path: /var/lib/mongodb/data
  - name: mongo-storage
    volume:
      size: 1G


The resulting file should look like the following screenshot. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-added-mongodb.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=650,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-added-mongodb.png]

Save the file so that the changes are persisted locally within the workspace.

[start=10]
. With the change in place, it is time to push this change to our git repository so we can give it a try. +
 +
To the right of the `devfile.yaml` in the `Explorer` view you can see `M` - this indicates that the file was modified and should be added and committed to the repository. +
 +
Again, in the left-hand side margin menu, click on the "Source Control" icon, then follow these steps:
  a. Click the `+` next to the `devfile.yaml` file
  b. Enter a commit message at the top - for example: "_Adding mongodb to my workspace_"
  c. Click the blue "Commit" button below
  d. Click the triple dots `...` in the top menu of the Source Control view, and select `push`

NOTE: The IDE may ask if you would like to periodically run git fetch. While it does not matter for this lab, it is good to see that this feature exists to assist with keeping your local clone current, but for now you can choose to answer either `Yes` or `No` to this question. There is no incorrect response to this prompt.

[start=11]
. The source code has been updated, but the runtime is still using the old devfile. Let's fix this by making the changes inline. Alternatively we could delete and re-create the workspace, but that would mean starting over for some of the other non-permanent changes we have made so far. +
 +
In the browser, you should find the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces dashboard as another tab - select this tab. Click on **Workspaces (1)** in the left hand side menu, and you should see the "guestbook" workspace running (a green circle next to it). +
 +
For this next step, it is crucial to click on `guestbook` in the center "Workspaces" view - not the left-hand side "Recent Workspaces". The former brings up the workspaces settings (which we want), while the latter brings up a new tab with an active window into the running workspace. +
 +
Click the **Devfile** tab to see the active runtime devfile. Similar to how we added the mongodb to the permanent devfile, let's copy the above snippet and paste it here as well - right before the `commands` section. +

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-added-mongodb-inline.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-added-mongodb-inline.png]

[start=12]
. Click the blue **Save** button in the bottom right corner. This will present a prompt asking if you want to "Restart Workspace" - answer **Yes** to this prompt.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-restart-workspace.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=550,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-restart-workspace.png]

[start=13]
. Next click the **guestbook** link in the left-hand side menu to re-open the session - now with the new runtime changes.

[start=14]
. Repeat step #6 from above by clicking the play icon of the "Build and Run the application" line in the "Task Manager"

[start=15]
. *Success* The Terminal is now just showing a few warnings, but otherwise also indicating that the app is listening on port 8080. Speaking of port 8080, there is a pop-up in the bottom right of the browser that is letting you know that there is a service listening on port 8080 and asking if you would like to open it - click the **Open in New Tab** blue button.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-open-port-8080.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=350,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-open-port-8080.png]

As a good security measurement, it will double-check and ask if you want to open this link - for this purpose, we do trust it, so click the blue **Open** button.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-port-8080-security.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=450,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-port-8080-security.png]

===== Congratulations 
You now have a working guestbook application. Feel free to try it out and submit names and messages to your guestbook. +
 +
*Bonus:* If you navigate back to the workspaces tab, you will now see your data is echoed to the Terminal window for debugging purposes.

=== Enhancing the Developer Environment Container

As you probably have observed, Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces itself is running as a pod with multiple containers. One of these containers is the main IDE container, and the base image used for this is fully controllable through the Devfile when launching a new Developer Environment. In many cases, the image used is the UDI - Universal Developer Image - as it has a lot of tools and runtime environments built-in. 

However, no image can have all tools that you might want to leverage built-in, and you may opt to maintain a set of smaller images rather than an all-inclusive - and hence large - image. 

In this section, you will get to experience how to modify the runtime container image to include additional tooling - in this case, some basic CLI tooling to interact with the mongodb that we added to the runtime above. 


[start=1]
. Within your Workspace, navigate to the Terminal and type `mongo` followed by a couple of tab- keystrokes. [If you don't want to exit out of the running application, you can open a new Terminal tab by pressing the plus sign on the top right of the existing terminal panel.] As you probably know from any Linux based environments, this would have either shown you available CLI tools that starts with mongo, or if there was only one command available it would autocomplete it. In this case, you will see that that nothing appears - as expected since we don't have any mongo CLI tools installed.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-terminal-no-mongotools.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=750,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-terminal-no-mongotools.png]

[start=2]
. Let us add some mongo CLI tools by amending the runtime container image we are using. +
 +
This is done by using a `Dockerfile` to add additional layers to the container image. For simplicity, we have already prepared a Dockerfile and corresponding https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cicd/builds/understanding-buildconfigs.html[BuildConfig] for this use. Let's take a closer look at those now. +
 +
First let's switch to the git branch that contains the solution files. This is done by using the left-hand side margin menu, click on the **Source Control** icon, then follow these steps:
  a. Click the `...` in the top menu 
  b. Click `Checkout to ..`
  c. Select `origin/demo-solution`

You should now see `demo-solution` listed as the active branch at the bottom of the window. If you have the Terminal tab open, hit the _Enter_ key and it will show `(demo-solution)` as part of the prompt. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-demo-solution-branch.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=750,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-demo-solution-branch.png]

[start=3]
. Before we explore the files behind this build, let us load up everything needed in OpenShift as the build may take a bit of time. +
 +
Using the Terminal window, it is now time to become more familiar with the `oc` CLI tool that is used to interact with OpenShift from the terminal. +
 +
Run `oc whoami` to verify that you have an active session - it should print your `userX` username.

Run `oc project <username>-devspaces`, for example `oc project user250-devspaces` if your username is `user250`

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-openshift-project.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=750,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-openshift-project.png]

[start=4]
. At the root level of your git repository, in the Terminal, run the following commands:

  a. `oc apply -f build/` 
  b. `oc start-build guestbook-dev-environment`

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-start-img-build.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=850,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-start-img-build.png]

[start=5]
. *Exploration Time!* Navigate to the OpenShift console to see the build we just started within OpenShift. 

  a. In the OpenShift web console, make sure to select "Administrator" at the top drop-down in the left-hand side menu to use the _Administrator_ perspective.
  b. Then, expand the **Builds** section on the left hand side, and click on **Builds**. 
  c. Click on the `+guestbook-dev-environment-*+` build to see more details including the logs of the active build that was previously triggered.
  d. Feel free to explore both the `BuildConfigs` and `ImageStreams` sections in the left hand side menu.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/openshift-guestbook-builds.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/openshift-guestbook-builds.png]

[start=6]
. To fully understand what that image build did, let's take a look at the _DockerFile_ used to perform the build. +
 + 
Navigate back the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces tab, and click **Explorer** in the left-hand side navigation menu, then select the `Dockerfile` file, which now should appear in the editor view in the middle. +
 +
This is a very minimal `Dockerfile` - it's based on the UDI image (mentioned above), and the only addition is to download and install the `mongodb-data-tools` RPM. +
 +
Feel free to also explore the files in the `build` directory - the `BuildConfig` and `ImageStream` - these were used to load up the necessary build in OpenShift to create this new image. 

[start=7]
. Wait for the image build to complete in OpenShift before continuing on to the next step - i.e.: the build should show a green checkmark and `Complete`

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/openshift-guestbook-build-complete.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/openshift-guestbook-build-complete.png]

[start=8]
. We need to grab the image path from the ImageStream so we can use it in the next step. In OpenShift, navigate to the **ImageStreams** page and click on **guestbook-dev-env**. About half-way down, highlight the Image Repository path below and copy it (**ctrl-c** or **right-click** >> **copy**)

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/openshift-guestbook-image-path.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/openshift-guestbook-image-path.png]

[start=9]
. Since this is a new image that we are still trialing to see if it meets our needs, we will just load it up temporarily by using the inline method we used earlier. This will reference the local image and let us test it before we make it permanent by pushing the image to a centralized image registry outside of the OpenShift environment and updating the Devfile with the new image. +
 +
Reference the above steps for how to navigate back to the inline view, and when you're there, look for the `image: 'registry.redhat.io/devspaces/udi-rhel8:3.5'` line within the `+nodejs+` container configuration - this is the one we are replacing with our newly built image. See screenshot below. 

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-image-update-inline.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=1000,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-image-update-inline.png]

Click **Save** to update the workspace (and **Yes** to restarting with the changes).

[start=10]
. Meanwhile, close down any old tabs to your active workspace, and click on the `guestbook` workspace in the left-hand side menu to re-open the newly re-launched workspace. +
 +
Note how everything has been preserved, including your previous file-view, extensions, etc.

[start=11]
. Back in the workspaces view, click the three lines (hamburger menu) at the top left, and select **Terminal** >> **New Terminal**.  +
 +
In the newly opened terminal, repeat the previous steps by attempting access the `mongo` CLI tools, e.g.: type `mongo`` then a few tab- keystrokes +
 +
Observe how there are now multiple `mongo` CLI tools available

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-available-mongo-commands.png[alt="OpenShift Overview",width=850,height=350,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs-events/summit-lab-2023/main/bookbag.instructions/workshop/content/media/devspaces-available-mongo-commands.png]

[start=11]
. Give one of the mongo commands a try, for example `mongotop`, with the following command: +
  `mongotop -u admin -p password --authenticationDatabase admin` +
+ 
This should connect to the locally deployed mongo and you should successfully see output relevant to the mongodb deployment.

===== Congratulations 
This concludes the `Junior Developer` exercise. To recap, here are a few things you have learned as part of this exercise:

  - Explored basic navigation of the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces environment within the web browser.
  - Used Devfiles to load up a consistent development environment.
  - Installed and used extensions (Task Manager) to navigate tasks defined in the DevFile.
  - Observed build warnings and deployment errors - and learned to fix them, permanently and temporarily testing it inline.
  - Connected with git (GitLab in this case) through an OAuth integration - i.e. no need for additional developer credentials.
  - Navigated across the IDE editor and source control features - such as branches and add/commit/push.
  - Built custom runtime developer environments by altering container images.
  - Observed how Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces allowed you to do all of these actions with ease, while your runtime was cached, allowing you to pick up right where you left off.

We truly hope you enjoyed this exercise. Now on to the `Advanced Developer` exercise, where things will be harder and not as thoroughly explained as it was for the `Junior Developer` exercise. 

*TIP:* Keep the `Junior Developer` exercise open in a separate tab to jump back here for guidance - if needed.
