= Bookbag Template

NOTE: This project is based on OpenShift Homeroom: https://github.com/openshift-homeroom.
This repository is based on https://github.com/openshift-homeroom/lab-asciidoc-sample.
If you are using OpenShift Homeroom project already, please continue using it.
If you want to integrate it with AgnosticD, follow the instructions in
<<If you Deploy Homeroom Directly from Agnosticd>>

This repository should be used as a template for creating (converting) lab content to
be used in Bookbag environments.

== Using this Template

Instructions on how to use this Template are describe in [https://github.com/redhat-gpte-labs/bookbag-demo

In short, the steps are:

. Create a new repository using this one as a GitHub template.

. Update the `build-template.yaml` to point to your repository.

. Select your deployment template, with our without OpenShift console access.

. Customize terminal settings in `envvars/gateway.sh` if desired.

. Define which modules you want to include in your lab.

. List the modules in the `workshop.yaml` file.

. Edit the `modules.yaml` file to specify modules names and transitions.

. Create the modules Asciidoc files (`workshop/content/*.adoc`).

. Build and test your lab instructions

== Building the Bookbag Image

. Create the bookbag BuildConfig and ImageStream:
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc process -f build-template.yaml | oc apply -f -*
----

. Build your image from local source or directly from Git source.
+
To build from local source (aka "binary build"):
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc start-build bookbag --follow --from-dir=.*
----
+
Build your Bookbag Image from Git (make sure you have set `GIT_REPO` in your build template!):
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc start-build bookbag --follow*
----

== Test Deploy of the Bookbag image

. Define a variables file, `workshop-vars.json`, to define variables for testing  your lab content:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "guid": "abcde",
    "example_var": 42,
    "ssh_command": "ssh lab-user@bastion.abcde.example.com",
    "ssh_password": "p4ssword!1",
    "user": "lab-user",
    "user_info_messages": "Example workshop messages:\nHello, World",
    "my": {
        "deep": {
            "var": "flattened data"
        }
    }
}
----
NOTE: Nested json data is now flattened and joined with a `.`.
Use in your asciidoc: %my.deep.var%

. Process the deploy template with your `workshop-vars.json`:
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc process -f deploy-template.yaml -p WORKSHOP_VARS="$(cat workshop-vars.json)" | oc apply -f -*
----

. Get the Bookbag's Route:
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc get route bookbag*
NAME     HOST/PORT                                  PATH  SERVICES  PORT       TERMINATION    WILDCARD
bookbag  bookbag-bookbag-demo.apps.ocp.example.com        bookbag   10080-tcp  edge/Redirect  None
----

. Use the Route hostname to open the Bookbag page in your browser.
